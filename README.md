## Overview

This challenge has something for everyone. It’s a HTML and CSS only project, but we’ve also provided a JSON file of the test results for anyone wanting to practice JS.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use the local JSON data to dynamically populate the content

### Useful resources
